## Pandemic impact on young Canadians with chronic health conditions

In February 2021 I began my postdoc. I work on a large observational multi-wave survey study on COVID-19 impacts.
Presently I am analyzing quasi-representative samples from Canada and evaluating the psychological impact of the pandemic on young Canadians with and without chronic health conditions. 

I am patiently waiting for feedback before I post anything more :)


## Fertility preservation in young people with cancer in Europe

I have started collaborating with [**Youth Cancer Europe**](https://www.youthcancereurope.org/) in 2019. I help with patient advocacy and research agenda, and work as a scientific liaison. We just launched a pan-European study on Fertility preservation services.

To read and learn more about the study click [**here**](https://osf.io/sr37b/). If you are a young person who has lived with cancer, you can also participate by following this link, or scanning the QR code below.
