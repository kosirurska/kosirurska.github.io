<h2>Pandemic impact on young Canadians with chronic health conditions</h2>
<p>In February 2021 I began my postdoc. I work on a large observational multi-wave survey study on COVID-19 impacts.
Presently I am analyzing quasi-representative samples from Canada and evaluating the psychological impact of the pandemic on young Canadians with and without chronic health conditions.</p>
<p>I am patiently waiting for feedback before I post anything more :)</p>
