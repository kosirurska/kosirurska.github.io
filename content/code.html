<p>This website was created in R Studio using Ivy Theme and is deployed using Netlify.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/rbind/yihui" class="uri">https://github.com/rbind/yihui</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I love the clean look and the simple structure of this site.
I am yet to figure out the customizing of domains on Github via personal pages and configuration of the domain with DNS.</p>
<p>You can see the code/repository <a href="https://github.com/kosirurska/kosirurska.github.io">here</a></p>
