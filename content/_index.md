I am a clinical and applied researcher with experience in oncology, mental health, and patient advocacy; it began with volunteering in mental health institutions in Italy, later in New Haven, continued at Yale School of Medicine where I worked on a clinical trial for weight loss intervention in under-served populations with severe mental illness, and landed me in the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford. 


In addition to my endless train of research ideas that span from new Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) measure development to understanding beliefs about cancer causes, [**I also continuously engage in patient advocacy and public speaking events with major European stakeholders**](https://blog.ehfg.org/2020/10/16/covid-19-spreading-the-importance-of-health-literacy-e1/) in healthcare. Pandemic aside, I love to attend global-scale medical conferences, where I promote patients' rights and work on incorporating patients in clinical research.
