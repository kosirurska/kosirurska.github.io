I am a trained clinical and applied researcher with experience in oncology, mental health, and patient advocacy; it began with volunteering in mental health institutions in Italy, later in New Haven, continued at Yale School of Medicine where I worked on a clinical trial for weight loss intervention in underprivileged populations with severe mental illness, and landed me in the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford. 

Currently, I am a postdoc in Canada. It's been great.

In addition to my endless train of research ideas that span from new PRO measure development to understanding beliefs about cancer causes, [**I also continuously engage in patient advocacy and public speaking events with major European stakeholders**](https://blog.ehfg.org/2020/10/16/covid-19-spreading-the-importance-of-health-literacy-e1/) in healthcare. Pandemic aside, I love to attend global-scale medical conferences, where I promote patients' rights and work on incorporating patients in clinical research.

Previously, I have also established a successful research committee at European Cancer Leagues (ECL) responsible for cancer prevention knowledge translation and managed an international team of experts to deliver [**novel health care policy recommendations**](https://www.healthparliament.eu/hlsc/) for the European Commission.
