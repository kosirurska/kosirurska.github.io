I am a trained clinical and applied researcher with experience in oncology, mental health, and patient advocacy; it began with volunteering at the pediatric and adult neuro-oncology clinics at Yale Smilow Cancer Hospital, continued at Yale School of Medicine where I worked on a clinical trial for weight loss intervention in underprivileged populations with severe mental illness, and landed me in the Department of Experimental Psychology at the University of Oxford. 

In addition to my endless train of research ideas that span from novel PRO measure development to understanding beliefs about cancer causes, [**I also constantly engage in patient advocacy and public speaking events with major European stakeholders**](https://blog.ehfg.org/2020/10/16/covid-19-spreading-the-importance-of-health-literacy-e1/) in healthcare. Pandemic aside, I love to attend global-scale medical conferences, where I promote patients' rights and work on incorporating patients in clinical research.

Previously, I have also established a successful research committee at European Cancer Leagues (ECL) responsible for cancer prevention knowledge translation and managed an international team of experts to deliver [**novel health care policy recommendations**](https://www.healthparliament.eu/hlsc/) for the European Commission.
